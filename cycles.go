package linkedListRiddles

// You get a node that is part of a linked list. The node has a next element and data.
// Your goal is to detect if the linked list contains cycles! Furthermore you must
// NOT alter the list in any way, your memory usage should be INDEPENDENT of the list's
// length (so no keeping track of all visited nodes) and should run in O(n)... so linear time
